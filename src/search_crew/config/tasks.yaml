    Research nutrition recommendations and restrictions for {health_condition} using only high-trust government sources (e.g., site:nih.gov, site:cdc.gov).
    Identify foods that are beneficial for managing this condition and those that should be limited or avoided.
    Consider interactions with common medications and both short-term and long-term nutritional approaches.
    You should:
    1. First, clearly identify the specific health condition provided by the user and confirm your understanding
    2. Use only reliable, government-backed sources: 
       - site:nih.gov
       - site:cdc.gov
       - site:usda.gov
       - site:.gov (general fallback)
    3. Form search queries like: 
       "nutritional recommendations for {health_condition} site:nih.gov OR site:cdc.gov OR site:.gov"
    4. Use GovRestrictedSearchTool for searching and ScrapeWebsiteTool for reading content.
    5. Only extract information directly from the text of those sites — do not infer or hallucinate.
    6. Structure the output:
       - Recommended foods with explanation of benefits
       - Foods to restrict or avoid with explanation of risks
       - Sample meal pattern appropriate for the condition
       - Nutrients of special concern (deficiencies or excess)
    7. Include both general principles and specific food examples
    8. Note if recommendations might conflict with other common conditions
